However, some players may want to change the language of the game but still keep the English subtitles for better understanding. This is possible by replacing the localised text file of the desired language with the English one. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.
 
## Step 1: Locate the Locale Folder
 
The first step is to locate the Locale folder of the game. This is where the game stores the localised text files for each language. To find it, go to your Steam library and right-click on Company of Heroes. Then select Properties and click on Browse Local Files. This will open the game folder in your file explorer.
 
From there, navigate to CoH > Engine > Locale. You should see a list of folders named after different languages, such as English, French, German, etc. These are the available languages for the game.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Folder and Download the English Text File
 
The next step is to create a new folder in the Locale folder and name it English. This will be where we will place the English text file that we will download later.

To download the English text file, use this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzsmb0w42ua1z15/RelicCOH.English.ucs?dl=0 [^1^]. This is a file that contains all the English text for the game, such as dialogue, menus, descriptions, etc.
 
Once you have downloaded the file, place it into the English folder that you just created. The file name should be RelicCOH.English.ucs.
 
## Step 3: Rename or Delete the Original Language Folder
 
The final step is to rename or delete the original language folder that you want to change. For example, if you want to change the language from German to English, you need to rename or delete the German folder in the Locale folder.
 
You can rename it by adding a prefix such as bak\_ or old\_ to it. For example, bak\_German or old\_German. This will prevent the game from picking up this folder as a valid language option.
 
You can also delete it entirely if you are sure that you don't need it anymore. However, this is not recommended as you may want to revert back to it later.
 
## Step 4: Launch the Game and Enjoy
 
Now you are ready to launch the game and enjoy it in your desired language with English subtitles. To do that, go back to your Steam library and launch Company of Heroes as usual.
 
You should see that the game has changed its language according to your choice. However, if you go to Options > Audio > Subtitles, you should see that they are still set to English.
 
This means that you can now hear the voice acting in your preferred language but still read the subtitles in English for better comprehension.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to change language and keep English subtitles in Company of Heroes by replacing the localised text file of your choice with the English one.
 
This is a simple and effective way to customize your game experience and enjoy it in different languages without losing any information.
