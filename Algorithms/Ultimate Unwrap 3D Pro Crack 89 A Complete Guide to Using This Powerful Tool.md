## Importing and Exporting 3D Models
 
The first step in UV mapping is to import your 3D model into Ultimate Unwrap 3D Pro 89. You can do this by clicking on the File menu and choosing Import. A dialog box will open where you can browse and select your file. You can also drag and drop your file into the main window of the program.
 
Ultimate Unwrap 3D Pro 89 supports over 100 file formats[^1^], so you can import models from various sources and applications. Some of the most common formats are FBX, DAE, ASE, DXF, LWO, OBJ, and DirectX. You can view a complete list of supported formats on the official website[^2^].
 
Once you have imported your model, you can view it in the main window. You can use the mouse and keyboard to rotate, zoom, pan, and select parts of your model. You can also use the View menu to change the display mode, lighting, shading, wireframe, grid, and more.
 
When you are done with UV mapping your model, you can export it by clicking on the File menu and choosing Export. A dialog box will open where you can choose your desired file format and settings. You can also use the Save As option to save your model as a U3D file, which is the native format of Ultimate Unwrap 3D Pro 89.
 
## Editing UV Coordinates and Projections
 
The next step in UV mapping is to edit the UV coordinates of your model. UV coordinates are numerical values that determine how a texture image is mapped onto a 3D surface. You can edit the UV coordinates of your model by using the UV Editor window, which is located at the bottom of the main window.
 
The UV Editor window shows a 2D representation of your model's UV map. You can use the mouse and keyboard to move, scale, rotate, flip, shear, weld, split, align, pack, and more with your UV map. You can also use the Edit menu to access various tools and commands for editing your UV map.
 
One of the most important aspects of editing your UV map is choosing the right projection method. A projection method is a way of generating initial UV coordinates for your model based on its shape. Ultimate Unwrap 3D Pro 89 offers a standard set of projection methods such as planar, box, cylindrical, spherical[^1^], as well as advanced projection methods such as face UV mapping and camera UV mapping[^1^]. You can access these projection methods by clicking on the Project menu or by using the toolbar buttons.
 
## Using Face UV Mapping and Camera UV Mapping
 
Face UV mapping and camera UV mapping are two advanced projection methods that can help you create better UV maps for complex models. Face UV mapping allows you to project a texture image onto each face of your model individually[^1^]. This way, you can avoid distortion and seams on curved or irregular surfaces. Camera UV mapping allows you to project a texture image onto your model from a specific camera angle[^1^]. This way, you can create realistic or artistic effects on your model.
