There are two ways to activate GTA IV PC: online activation and manual activation. Online activation is the easiest and fastest way, but it requires an active Internet connection on the computer where the game is installed. Manual activation is an alternative method that can be used if you do not have an Internet connection or if your firewall blocks the online activation.
 
## Online Activation
 
Online activation is performed during the installation of GTA IV PC or by running the game again after installation is complete. When you are prompted to activate the game, follow these steps:
 
1. Enter your product code (serial number) that you can find on the back of your game manual or in a billing email if you bought the game online. The product code has this format: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX.
2. Click on "Activate" and wait for the activation process to complete. You may need to allow GTA IV PC to access the Internet through your firewall.
3. If the activation is successful, you will see a confirmation message and you can start playing the game.

## Manual Activation
 
Manual activation is a three-step process that involves collecting some codes from your computer, generating an unlock code on another computer with Internet access, and entering the unlock code on your computer. Here are the steps:
 
### Step 1: Collect Product Code and Unlock Request Code
 
You will need to collect two codes from your computer: your product code (serial number) and your unlock request code. To do this:

1. Run GTA IV PC on your computer. If you do not have an Internet connection or if online activation fails, you will see a screen that says "Unable to connect to activation server". Click on "Activate manually".
2. You will see a screen that shows your product code (serial number) and your unlock request code. Write down these codes or copy and paste them into a text file. You will need them for the next step.

### Step 2: Generate Unlock Code
 
You will need to generate an unlock code on another computer that has Internet access and no firewall restrictions. To do this:
