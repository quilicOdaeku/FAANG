In this review, we will take a closer look at the features and performance of Tampa Rebooted v2.4 for FSX, P3D and P3Dv4, and see how it compares to the real airport and other sceneries in the market.
 
## Installation and Configuration
 
Tampa Rebooted v2.4 is available for purchase from FlyTampa's website for $28 USD. The download size is about 1.5 GB, and the installation process is straightforward and user-friendly. You just need to run the installer, enter your serial number, and select your preferred options. The scenery comes with a configuration tool that allows you to customize various aspects of the scenery, such as texture resolution, dynamic lighting, animated objects, static aircraft, 3D grass, and more. You can also enable or disable the city scenery and the surrounding airports (KPIE and KTPF).
 
## Features and Performance
 
Tampa Rebooted v2.4 is a stunning scenery that captures the essence and atmosphere of Tampa International Airport and its surroundings. The airport itself is modeled with great accuracy and detail, with crisp textures, realistic shadows, and smooth animations. The terminal buildings are faithful to their real counterparts, with accurate signs, logos, and interiors. The jetways are animated and compatible with SODE or Ctrl+J commands, depending on your preference. The aprons and runways are also well done, with realistic markings, reflections, and wear-and-tear effects.
 
The scenery also includes a lot of custom ground vehicles and static aircraft that add life and realism to the airport. You can see various types of vehicles moving around the airport, such as baggage carts, fuel trucks, pushback tugs, fire trucks, police cars, buses, and more. The static aircraft are also varied and representative of the airlines that operate at KTPA, such as Southwest, Delta, American Airlines, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines, and more.
 
One of the most impressive features of Tampa Rebooted v2.4 is the dynamic lighting system that enhances the night environment of the airport. The lighting effects are realistic and immersive, with different colors and intensities depending on the source. The terminal buildings are illuminated with warm yellow lights that contrast with the cool blue lights of the jetways. The aprons and runways are also well lit with white lights that cast realistic shadows on the ground.

The scenery also covers the city of Tampa and its surroundings, with custom 3D buildings, landmarks, bridges, and vegetation. The city scenery is not as detailed as some other products in the market, but it still adds a lot of immersion and realism to the overall experience. You can recognize some of the iconic landmarks of Tampa, such as the Amalie Arena, the Raymond James Stadium, the Tampa Convention Center, and more. The bridges over the bay are also well modeled, with realistic textures and lighting effects. The vegetation is also varied and dense, with different types of trees and bushes.
 
Tampa Rebooted v2.4 is a very performance-friendly scenery, despite its high level of detail and complexity. The scenery runs smoothly and without any noticeable stutters or pauses on my system, which is not very high-end (FSX:SE, i5-4460, GTX 1050 Ti, 8 GB RAM). The frame rates are stable and consistent, even with high traffic and weather settings. The scenery also blends well with other add-ons, such as ORBX Global and Active Sky.
