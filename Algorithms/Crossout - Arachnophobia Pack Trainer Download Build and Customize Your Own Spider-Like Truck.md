The Arachnophobia Pack is not only a cool-looking vehicle pack, but also a strategic one. The Tarantula truck and the Steppe Spider cabin have some unique features and advantages that can give you an edge in combat. Here are some tips on how to use them effectively:

- Use the ML-200 mechanical legs to adapt to the terrain and the situation. You can raise or lower your vehicle, tilt it forward or backward, and even climb walls and obstacles. This can help you avoid enemy fire, reach high places, or ambush enemies from unexpected angles.
- Use the Steppe Spider cabin's perk to save energy and boost your weapons. The perk reduces the energy consumption of weapons by 1 point for each enemy within a 100-meter radius, up to a maximum of 4 points. This means you can equip more or heavier weapons on your vehicle, or use modules that require energy. The perk also works for your allies, so stay close to them and support them with your fire.
- Use the Rapier autocannons to deal consistent damage at medium range. The Rapier autocannons have good accuracy and cooling, which means you can fire them continuously without overheating. They also have a decent damage and penetration, which can damage both light and heavy armor. Aim for the weak spots of your enemies, such as weapons, wheels, or cabins.
- Use the Spyder hero portrait, the Web and Crater camouflages, and the in-game coins to customize your vehicle and show off your style. The Spyder hero portrait is a unique and mysterious portrait that suits the theme of the pack. The Web and Crater camouflages are exclusive dyes that can make your vehicle look more spider-like or blend in with the environment. The in-game coins can be used to buy or sell items on the market, such as other weapons, modules, or cosmetics.

The Arachnophobia Pack is a fun and versatile vehicle pack that can suit different playstyles and preferences. Whether you want to be stealthy, aggressive, supportive, or creative, you can find something to enjoy in this pack. The Arachnophobia Pack is available for a limited time only, so don't hesitate to get it while you can!
