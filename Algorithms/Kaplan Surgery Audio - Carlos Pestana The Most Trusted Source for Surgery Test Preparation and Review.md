## What are the benefits of the Kaplan Surgery Audio lectures?
 
There are several benefits of using the Kaplan Surgery Audio lectures as part of your surgery preparation. Some of them are:
 
- They are concise and comprehensive. The audio lectures cover all the major topics in surgery, such as trauma, vascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, breast, urology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and more. They also include relevant anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and microbiology. Each lecture is about 30 minutes long, which makes them easy to listen to and review.
- They are case-based and clinically oriented. The audio lectures use real-life cases to illustrate the principles and management of surgical conditions. Dr. Pestana explains the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, workup, treatment, complications, and prognosis of each case in a logical and systematic way. He also provides tips and tricks on how to approach surgical questions on the exam.

## What are the drawbacks of the Kaplan Surgery Audio lectures?
 
While the Kaplan Surgery Audio lectures are a great resource for surgery, they are not perfect. Some of the drawbacks of using them are:

- They are not updated frequently. The audio lectures were recorded several years ago and may not reflect the latest guidelines and evidence in surgery. Some of the information may be outdated or inaccurate. You should always supplement the audio lectures with other sources of updated information, such as textbooks, journals, or online resources.
- They are not sufficient by themselves. The audio lectures are meant to be a review and not a substitute for learning surgery. They do not cover every detail or nuance that you may encounter on the exam or in clinical practice. You should always read the book *Surgery: A Case Based Clinical Review* by Dr. Pestana or other comprehensive books on surgery to get a deeper understanding of the topics.
- They are not interactive or customizable. The audio lectures are pre-recorded and fixed in format. You cannot ask questions, pause, rewind, or skip parts of the lectures. You also cannot adjust the speed or volume of the audio files. You have to listen to them as they are and follow along with the book or notes.

## How to use the Kaplan Surgery Audio lectures effectively?
 
To get the most out of the Kaplan Surgery Audio lectures, you should follow these tips:

- Listen to them early and often. The audio lectures are best used as a review tool after you have learned the basics of surgery from other sources. You should listen to them at least once before taking the exam and preferably multiple times to reinforce your knowledge and retention.
- Listen to them actively and attentively. The audio lectures are not meant to be background noise or passive listening. You should pay attention to what Dr. Pestana is saying and try to understand his reasoning and logic. You should also take notes or highlight key points in the book or notes as you listen.
