In this article, we will show you how to use Vmixtitlepack1 to create stunning live titles for your vMix projects. You will need vMix 4k or PRO version to use the effects of the GT Designer. You can download Vmixtitlepack1 from [vMixPresets](https://www.vmixpresets.com/products/all-titles-pack), a website that offers various presets and templates for vMix users.
 
## Step 1: Install Vmixtitlepack1
 
After you purchase Vmixtitlepack1 from vMixPresets, you will receive a zip file containing all the titles. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer. You will see a subfolder for each category of titles, such as "LOWERS", "NEWS", "SPORTS", etc. Inside each subfolder, you will find a .vMixTitle file for each title. These are the files that you will import into vMix.
 
## Step 2: Import Titles into vMix
 
Open vMix and go to the Titles tab. Click on the Add button and select Title/XAML from the dropdown menu. A window will pop up where you can browse for the .vMixTitle file that you want to import. Select one of the files from Vmixtitlepack1 and click Open. The title will be added to your Titles list and previewed on the screen. You can repeat this process for as many titles as you want to import.
 
## Step 3: Customize Titles in GT Designer
 
If you want to change the text, color, font, size, position, animation, or any other aspect of the title, you can use the GT Designer to edit it. To open the GT Designer, right-click on the title in the Titles list and select Edit Title from the menu. The GT Designer window will open where you can see all the layers and properties of the title. You can use the tools on the left side to modify the title as you wish. For example, you can use the Text tool to edit the text content and style, or use the Color tool to change the color of any layer. You can also use the Timeline at the bottom to adjust the timing and duration of the animations.
 
When you are happy with your changes, click on Save and Close to return to vMix. The title will be updated with your modifications.
 
## Step 4: Use Titles in Your Live Production
 
Now that you have imported and customized your titles, you can use them in your live production. To do so, simply drag and drop the title from the Titles list to any of the overlay channels in vMix. The title will appear on top of your main video source. You can also use shortcuts or triggers to control when and how the title is displayed or hidden.
 
You can also mix and match different titles from Vmixtitlepack1 to create different scenes and layouts for your live production. For example, you can use a lower third title with a news ticker title to create a news-style scene, or use a sports scoreboard title with a sports logo title to create a sports-style scene.
