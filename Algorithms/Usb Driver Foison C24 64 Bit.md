- Make sure you use high-quality vinyl materials that are compatible with your plotter. Different vinyl types may require different settings and blades. You can check the manual or contact the supplier for more information.
- Keep your plotter clean and well-maintained. Dust and dirt can affect the performance and accuracy of your plotter. You should regularly clean the blade holder, carriage, rollers, and cutting strip with a soft cloth or brush. You should also lubricate the rails and bearings with oil or grease periodically.
- Replace your blades when they become dull or damaged. A dull blade can cause incomplete cuts, jagged edges, or tearing of the vinyl. You should check the condition of your blade before each cut and replace it if necessary. You can also adjust the blade depth and offset according to the thickness of your vinyl.
- Calibrate your plotter regularly. Calibration ensures that your plotter cuts accurately and consistently according to your design. You can calibrate your plotter by using the test cut function in Artcut or by following the instructions in the manual.
- Troubleshoot any problems that may arise. If you encounter any issues with your plotter such as error messages, communication errors, or poor quality cuts, you should try to identify and fix them as soon as possible. You can refer to the manual or contact the technical support for assistance.

By following these tips, you can ensure that your Foison C24 works smoothly and efficiently for a long time.
