## The History of the Buena Vista Social Club
 
The name **Buena Vista Social Club** comes from a members-only club that existed in Havana in the 1940s. The club was a popular venue for musicians and dancers who enjoyed playing and listening to son, a style of music that combines Spanish guitar and African rhythms. The club was closed in the early 1960s after the Cuban Revolution, and many of its performers faded into obscurity.
 
In 1996, Ry Cooder traveled to Cuba with the intention of recording an album with some Malian musicians who were visiting the island. However, due to visa problems, the Malian musicians could not arrive on time. Cooder then decided to look for local Cuban musicians who could collaborate with him on the project. He was assisted by Juan de Marcos GonzÃ¡lez, a Cuban bandleader and producer who had previously worked with some of the old soneros.
 
GonzÃ¡lez and Cooder gathered a group of veteran musicians, some of whom were in their 80s and 90s, and brought them to a studio in Havana. There, they recorded an album in just six days, using mostly live takes and minimal overdubs. The album was named *Buena Vista Social Club*, in honor of the old club where many of them had performed decades ago.
