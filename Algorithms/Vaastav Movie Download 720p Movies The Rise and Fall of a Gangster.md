Vaastav is not just a movie, but a cinematic experience that will leave you spellbound by its powerful story, direction, performances and music. The movie has received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, who have praised it for its realistic portrayal of the Mumbai underworld and its impact on the lives of ordinary people.
 
Some of the reviews of Vaastav are as follows:

> "Vaastav is a harrowing look at the realities the lower middle class face, and how easy it is for the youth of that class to be drawn to the glamor and glitz of crime. Raghu starts off the film with honest intentions, but circumstances quickly force him into a life of violence and corruption. Sanjay Dutt delivers his best performance as Raghu, a man who loses his identity and humanity in the process of becoming a gangster. The film is gritty, dark and uncompromising in its depiction of the underworld and its consequences."[^2^]

> "Vaastav is incredibly acted. Occasionally the dialogues tend to get long and somewhat derivative but it holds up as one of the best of the genre in Indian cinema. That incredibly haunting final scene itself holds up as one of the most memorable and terrifying movie ending I've seen in my life. Probably my 5th watch for this movie and it still engulfs you into the spiralling life of Raghu."[^2^]

> "Bollywood Scarface. Sanjay dutt is brilliant. His best role to date. Non traditional Bollywood story which explores the frowned upon subjects of rampant murder prostitution and street life in india. Truly in its own class for a Eastern film theyâve tried to copy its magic time and time again but never seem to crack the code. Canât recommend it enough one of the true gems of Bollywood."[^2^]
