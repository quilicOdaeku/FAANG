
 
KAT, which stands for Kickass Torrents, is a website that follows the same model as The Pirate Bay. It does not directly host any files that infringe on the copyrights of content creators, such as TV shows, movies, and music. Instead, it provides links to .torrent and .magnet files that allow users to download these unauthorized copies from other BitTorrent users who are sharing them. This way, KAT avoids the legal liability of hosting infringing content on its servers.
