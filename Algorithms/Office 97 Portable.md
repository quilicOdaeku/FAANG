Office 97 Portable is not an official product from Microsoft, but rather a fan-made project that uses the files from the Office 97 CD-ROM. You can download it from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/office97standard_201912), where you can also find the original Office 97 Standard Edition[^1^]. You will need a USB stick with at least 500 MB of free space to copy the files.
 
To run Office 97 Portable, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the Office 97 Portable ZIP file from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/office97standard_201912) and extract it to your USB stick.
2. Open the folder "Office97" on your USB stick and double-click on "Office.exe". This will launch a menu where you can choose which application to run.
3. Select the application you want to use and enjoy Office 97 on any Windows computer.

Note that some features of Office 97 may not work properly on newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 10. You may also encounter some compatibility issues with newer file formats or fonts.
