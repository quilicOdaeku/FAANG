# How to Find and Use Red Giant Primatte Keyer Serial Number
 
Red Giant Primatte Keyer is a powerful plugin for fast, automatic chroma keying in Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro. Whether you are using a green screen or blue screen, Primatte Keyer's auto compute algorithms can often pull a perfect key automatically. The new user interface and clean up tools make it easy to select and separate your background and foreground. Primatte Keyer is also GPU optimized, making it up to 3x faster than previous versions.
 
If you want to use Primatte Keyer, you need to have a valid serial number that belongs to the product. A serial number is a code that identifies your license and allows you to activate the plugin on your computer. Without a serial number, you will see a red "X" watermark on your footage.

## How to Use Primatte Keyer to Create Green Screen Effects
 
Now that you have activated Primatte Keyer, you can start using it to create stunning green screen effects for your videos. Here are some basic steps to follow:

1. First, you need to have a footage layer that contains your green screen or blue screen background. This can be a video clip or a still image. Make sure the background is evenly lit and has no shadows or wrinkles.
2. Next, you need to have another footage layer that contains your foreground element. This can be a person, an object, a logo, or anything else you want to composite over the background. Make sure the foreground element is well defined and has no green or blue spill.
3. Then, you need to drag and drop your background layer onto your timeline and place it below your foreground layer. You can adjust the position and scale of the layers as needed.
4. Finally, you need to apply Primatte Keyer to your foreground layer. You can find the plugin in the Effects panel under Red Giant VFX > Primatte Keyer 6. When you apply the effect, you will see a control panel with several options and tools.

The most important tool in Primatte Keyer is the Auto Define Key button. This button automatically analyzes your footage and removes the green or blue background with one click. You can also use the eyedropper tool to manually select the background color if needed.
 
After you use the Auto Define Key button, you will see a matte view of your footage. The matte view shows you what parts of your footage are transparent (black), opaque (white), or semi-transparent (gray). You can use the other tools in Primatte Keyer to refine your matte and improve your key.
