In this section, we will give you some tips and tricks on how to play Zoo Tycoon: Marine Mania and Dinosaur Digs. These games can be quite challenging and fun, but also require some strategy and planning. Here are some things you should keep in mind:

1. Choose your animals wisely. Different animals have different needs, behaviors, and preferences. You should research each animal before you buy it and make sure you can provide it with a suitable habitat, food, water, enrichment, and socialization. Some animals are more popular with guests than others, so you should also consider their appeal and profitability.
2. Expand your zoo gradually. Don't try to build too much too fast, or you might run out of money, space, or staff. Start with a few exhibits and attractions and then add more as you earn more income and reputation. You should also balance your expenses and income by adjusting your ticket prices, staff salaries, research budget, and advertising.
3. Keep your guests happy. Your guests are the main source of your income and reputation, so you should make sure they have a good time at your zoo. You can do this by providing them with amenities like restrooms, food stands, gift shops, benches, trash cans, and information booths. You should also keep your zoo clean and safe by hiring janitors, security guards, and veterinarians.
4. Keep your animals healthy. Your animals are the main attraction of your zoo, so you should make sure they are well taken care of. You can do this by hiring animal keepers, trainers, and veterinarians to feed, clean, train, and heal your animals. You should also monitor their health, happiness, and stress levels and address any issues that arise.
5. Complete the scenarios and challenges. The games offer various scenarios and challenges that test your skills as a zoo manager. You can access them from the main menu or the game mode selection screen. Each scenario and challenge has a specific goal and a time limit that you have to achieve. Completing them will reward you with money, fame points, new animals, buildings, or features.
