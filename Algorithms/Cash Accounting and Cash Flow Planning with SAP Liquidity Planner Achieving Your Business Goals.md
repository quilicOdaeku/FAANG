Cash accounting and cash flow planning are essential tasks for any business that wants to manage its liquidity effectively. Cash accounting involves recording the inflows and outflows of cash based on actual transactions, while cash flow planning involves forecasting the future cash flows based on various assumptions and scenarios. Both tasks require accurate and timely information from various sources, such as bank statements, financial accounting, and liquidity planning.
 
SAP Liquidity Planner is a powerful tool that can help you perform cash accounting and cash flow planning using SAP R/3 and SAP BW/SEM. SAP Liquidity Planner consists of two main components: SAP Actual Calculation (cash accounting) and SAP BW/SEM (liquidity planning and reporting). SAP Actual Calculation allows you to extract, assign, and analyze cash-related information from SAP R/3, such as bank statements, financial accounting documents, and manual entries. SAP BW/SEM allows you to model, plan, and report on your liquidity using SAP Business Warehouse (BW) and Strategic Enterprise Management (SEM).

## SAP Actual Calculation (Cash Accounting)
 
SAP Actual Calculation is the component of SAP Liquidity Planner that enables you to perform cash accounting in SAP R/3. It allows you to extract cash-related information from various sources in SAP R/3, such as bank statements, financial accounting documents, payment orders, manual entries, etc. It also allows you to assign this information to different liquidity items, which are predefined categories that represent the nature and purpose of the cash flows. For example, you can assign a bank statement line item to a liquidity item such as "Sales Revenue" or "Interest Expense".
 
By assigning liquidity items to cash-related information, you can create a consistent and transparent data model for cash accounting. You can also analyze your cash flows by using various reports that are based on liquidity items. For example, you can use the Cash Position report to see your daily or weekly cash inflows and outflows by liquidity item. You can also use the Cash Flow Statement report to see your monthly or quarterly cash flows by liquidity item according to the indirect method.
 
To implement SAP Actual Calculation, you need to perform some technical settings in SAP R/3, such as activating the business function FIN\_FSCM\_CLM, creating a ledger for cash accounting, defining posting rules for bank statements, etc. You also need to customize SAP Actual Calculation according to your business requirements, such as defining liquidity items, creating assignment mechanisms, setting up manual entries, etc.
  
## SAP BW/SEM (Liquidity Planning and Reporting)
 
SAP BW/SEM is the component of SAP Liquidity Planner that enables you to perform liquidity planning and reporting using SAP BW and SEM. It allows you to model your liquidity structure using master data objects such as bank accounts, bank account groups, currencies, planning levels, etc. It also allows you to plan your future cash flows using various methods such as copying actual data from SAP R/3 or SAP BW, entering manual data in Excel or web interfaces, using formulas or drivers for calculations, etc.
 
By planning your future cash flows using SAP BW/SEM, you can create a comprehensive and realistic picture of your liquidity situation. You can also compare your actual and planned cash flows by using various reports that are based on key figures such as opening balance, closing balance, inflow amount, outflow amount, etc. For example, you can use the Liquidity Forecast report to see your medium-term or long-term cash flows by bank account group or currency. You can also use the Liquidity Analysis report to see your short-term or medium-term cash flows by liquidity item or planning level.
 
To implement SAP BW/SEM, you need to perform some modeling tasks in SAP BW and SEM, such as activating the business content for liquidity planning (0FICM\_C01), creating master data objects for bank accounts and bank account groups (0BANK\_ACCOUNT), defining characteristics for liquidity items and planning levels (0LIQUIDITY\_ITEM), creating layouts for planning in SEM-B
